Build a Lost-inspired “108-minute hatch countdown” web mini-game in plain JS with a single 800×600 canvas (no external libraries). Flow: show a short cutscene screen with a “Start” button; when pressed, start a 108:00 countdown and persist it using localStorage by storing endTime = Date.now() + 108601000. The countdown must continue correctly across refreshes by recomputing remaining time from endTime each frame. Render a hatch-style digital clock (MMM:SS) using a custom 7-segment renderer on canvas with red glow and subtle flicker. When remaining time <= 4:00 and > 0, display a keypad overlay for code entry (mouse clickable digits + keyboard digits). Only allow code submission during this window; if correct code entered before 0, show SUCCESS and reset/stop timer; if timer reaches 0, show FAIL screen with flashing effect and reset option. Include states (CUTSCENE, RUNNING, CODE_WINDOW, SUCCESS, FAIL), debug toggle (D) to show endTime/remainingMs, and a reset key (R) to clear localStorage and restart. Deliver complete index.html + game.js.
